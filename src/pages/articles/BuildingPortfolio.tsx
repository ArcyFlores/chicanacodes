  const content = `Your portfolio is your digital business card, your first impression, and often the deciding factor in landing your dream job in tech. Let's build one that showcases your skills and tells your unique story.

## Why Your Portfolio Matters

In the tech industry, your portfolio is often more important than your resume. It shows:
- Your actual coding skills in action
- Your design sensibility and attention to detail
- Your ability to solve problems and build complete projects
- Your personality and what makes you unique

## Essential Elements of a Great Portfolio

### 1. Professional Header
Start with a clean, professional header that includes:
- Your name prominently displayed
- A professional photo (optional but recommended)
- Your title (e.g., "Frontend Developer", "Full Stack Engineer")
- Contact information and social links

### 2. Compelling About Section
Tell your story! Include:
- Your journey into tech
- What motivates you as a developer
- Your technical interests and specialties
- Personal touches that make you memorable

**Example:**
"I'm Ana Martinez, a passionate frontend developer who transitioned from marketing to tech. I love creating beautiful, accessible web experiences that make a difference in people's lives. When I'm not coding, you can find me mentoring other Latinas in tech or perfecting my abuela's tamale recipe."

### 3. Skills Section
Organize your skills into categories:

**Frontend:**
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- React, Vue.js, or Angular
- Responsive Design, CSS Grid, Flexbox

**Backend:**
- Node.js, Python, or PHP
- Express.js, Django, or Laravel
- RESTful APIs, GraphQL

**Tools & Technologies:**
- Git/GitHub, VS Code
- Webpack, Vite
- Testing frameworks (Jest, Cypress)
- Deployment (Netlify, Vercel, Heroku)

### 4. Project Showcase

This is the heart of your portfolio. For each project, include:

**Project Title & Description**

- 2-3 sentence summary of what it does
- The problem it solves

**Technologies Used**
- List all major technologies and frameworks
- Highlight any new technologies you learned

## Project Ideas to Include

### 1. Personal Project
Something that reflects your interests or solves a problem you care about:

Your portfolio MUST look great on all devices:

## Content Writing Tips

### Be Authentic
Write in your own voice. Don't try to sound like someone else. Your personality should shine through.

### Focus on Impact
Instead of just listing features, explain the impact:
- "Increased user engagement by 40% through improved UX design"
- "Reduced page load time by 60% through code optimization"

### Use Action Words
Start descriptions with strong verbs:
- "Built", "Developed", "Designed", "Implemented", "Optimized"

### Show Your Process
Don't just show the final result. Explain:
- Challenges you faced and how you solved them
- Technologies you learned specifically for the project
- What you would do differently next time

## Technical Implementation

### Choose Your Platform

**Custom Built (Recommended)**
- Shows your coding skills directly
- Complete creative control
- Use React, Vue, or vanilla JavaScript

**Website Builders**
- Faster to set up
- Good for non-developers
- Consider Webflow, Squarespace, or WordPress

### Hosting Options
- **Netlify**: Great for static sites, easy deployment from Git
- **Vercel**: Perfect for React/Next.js applications
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for static sites
- **Firebase**: Good for full-stack applications

### Domain Name
Invest in a professional domain:
- Use your name: anamaartinez.com
- Keep it simple and memorable
- Avoid numbers and hyphens

## SEO and Discoverability

### Meta Tags
Include proper meta descriptions and titles for each page.

### Keywords
Naturally include relevant keywords:
- "Frontend Developer"
- "React Developer"
- "Web Developer"
- Your location if relevant

### Google Analytics
Track your portfolio's performance to see what's working.

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Updates
- Add new projects as you complete them
- Update skills as you learn new technologies
- Keep contact information current

### Get Feedback
- Ask other developers for honest feedback
- Test with people outside of tech
- Use tools like Hotjar to see how users interact with your site

### Performance Monitoring
- Regularly check site speed
- Test on different devices and browsers
- Monitor for broken links

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Many Projects**: Quality over quantity (3-5 strong projects)
2. **Outdated Information**: Keep everything current
3. **Poor Mobile Experience**: Always test on mobile
4. **Broken Links**: Regularly check all links work
5. **Generic Content**: Make it personal and authentic
6. **No Contact Information**: Make it easy for employers to reach you

## Examples of Great Portfolios

Study portfolios from successful developers in your field. Look for:
- Clean, professional design
- Clear project descriptions
- Easy navigation
- Personal branding

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio is an ongoing process. Start with the basics and improve it over time. Remember, your portfolio should reflect not just your technical skills, but also your personality and passion for development.

Your portfolio is often the first thing potential employers see. Make it count! Show them not just what you can build, but who you are as a developer and as a person.

Â¡A por ello! (Go for it!) Your dream job is waiting, and your portfolio is the key to unlocking it.`;
